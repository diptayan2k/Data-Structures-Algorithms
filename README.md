# Data-Structures-Algorithms
C++ implemantation of different Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Disjoint Set Data Structures
Disjoint Set Union algorithm is implemented  using arrays in c++.

## Topological-Sort
C++ inplementation of Topological Sort for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG .
